# Sonic Ring Animation with Canvas

I wanted to play around with canvas to create something arty with Canvas. Rings that spin like those in Sonic the Hedgehog games are generated, from where the mouse position is. Holding various keys modifies the behaviour of rings generated. This was fun, because once the initial engine was creating, adding new functionality became a fairly straightforward task - essentially tweaking environment variables which are used in the formulas.
